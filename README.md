We're pretty sure all this attention is likely to make you uncomfortable. We acknowledge that, we respect that, and we love you for it... **but** saving thoughts like this for your eulogy feels like a waste. That said, don't worry, we're not going into too much detail; we're simply stating some facts and hoping to provide future generations some insight into those who came before them. 

Knowing where we came from is an important part of understanding who we are and knowing _who_ brought us into this world is a part of that. As time, and generations, pass our collective family knowledge loses some fidelity and mitigating that is one of the project goals.


We've also put this together to recognize the simple fact that, without Jerry Johnson, the world would be a lesser place. And without his children, Matthew and Samuel, ... and so on down the line.

One person can make an extraordinary impact in the lives of others. Consider, for a start, how much different the lives of Angela Kazik, Mary Rae Berken, Shawna VanGemeret and Angela Bougie would be today without a Jerry Johnson in the world.

That's enough of a snapshot for now. The primary goal is to collect an oral history of the De Pere Johnsons, starting with the current patriarch. At a minimum we'll spend an hour a month, over the twelve months of 2023, to record conversations following a format based roughly on this [toolkit](https://recollectionwisconsin.org/the-toolkit-recording-oral-histories). Additionally we have set this space up in GitHub, which is (As of 2023) a place where we can store all-things-Johnson for... ever.


Visionaries that we are, there are all sorts of tangents this opens up, and fun things we can do with the all-things-Johnson collection:

- Private YouTube Channel
- Private Johnson Family Blog & App
- Collectible Merch
- Digital Memorial

We do, though, have to start somewhere and that somewhere is, in fact, right here. 

Love,  

Your Boys
